Train Neural Network with ABC and Backpropagation

This is a little project about how to train a neural network using Artificial Bee Colony and Backpropagation
ABC_NN_Ver21_Beta - Copy.py: contains the ABC heuristic and is able to train a set of images from a directory, you can define image file type to search and load into memory to normalize the data and train the neural network, all results are dumped into different files.

RecognizeImageABC.py: With this file, you can evaluate the obtained trained results (ABC_NN_Ver21_Beta - Copy.py), in this case, you can use the same images trained or use images with noise to evaluate the accuracy of recognition.

BackPropagation.py: contains the backpropagation heuristic and is able to train a set of images from a directory, you can define image file type to search and load into memory to normalize the data and train the neural network, all results are dumpled into different files.

Recognize_Image_BP.py: With this file, you can evaluate the obtained trained results (BackPropagation.py), in this case, you can use the same images trained or use images with noise to evaluate the accuracy of recognition.
